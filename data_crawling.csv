Complex system problems related to climate change, reduced fossil-based energy reserves, and social environmental problems that have an impact on the economy have made stakeholders aware of the Education for Sustainability Development (ESD) program. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of STEM-PBL integrated Engineering Design Process (EDP) in renewable energy learning units to improve students’ system thinking skills. The quantitative experimental research with a non-equivalent control group design was conducted on 67 high school students in XI grades. The results showed that the performance of students who were taught with STEM-EDP was better than students who studied with traditional STEM learning approach. In
addition, this learning strategy also encourages students to be actively involved in every EDP process so that they show good performance in mind-on and hands-on activities which have an impact on increasing students’ system thinking abilities. Furthermore, the STEM-EDP learning is implemented to develop students’ ability to design through applied technology and engineered activities, paying special attention to design-based theory. It does not require students and teachers to prepare super-sophisticated technology, because the integration of technology in this
learning design used cheap, simple and ‘easy to find’ equipments, to create more meaningful learning packages. In the critical pedagogy, STEM-PBL integrated EDP can be used to systematically foster students’ STEM literacy and thinking skills through the engineering design thinking
process, thus expanding students’ cognitive building and perspectives in reducing the routine in conventional pedagogy.",['L1'],Heliyon

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of tillage and fertilization on the quantity and intensity (Q/I) of Ammonium (CRNH40, PBCNH4+, NH40, KG) in the soil, plant N and C uptake, and mung bean yields at the sixth growing season in ultisols. This study was arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial in a Randomized Block Design (RBD). The first factor was the tillage system (T), namely minimum tillage (T0) and intensive tillage (T1). The second factor was the fertilization (P), namely without fertilizer application (P0), and with fertilizer application (NPK 200 kg ha-1 + 1 Mg ha-1 chicken manure) (P1). Each treatment was replicated four times. The results showed that the application of NPK fertilizer significantly affected the mung bean yield, mung bean plant Nitrogen and Carbon uptake at harvest time. While, the intensive tillage had a very significant effect on increasing the N uptake compared to the minimum tillage. Minimum tillage and fertilization increased Q/I parameters (PBCNH4+, KG, CRNH40, and NH40). The parameter of Q/I (CRNH40) was significantly correlated with mung bean plant N and C uptake. PBCNH4+ and KG were significantly correlated with mung bean yields.",['S1'],

This research was to study the phytoremediation potential of several plants in heavy-metal polluted tropical soils.  Soil samples were collected from experimental plots amended in 1998 with 0, 15, and 60 Mg industrial waste ha-1.  The soil samples were planted in a glass-house experiment with 3 different plants i.e caisim (Brassica chinensis var. Parachinensis), water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica), and lettuce (Lactuca sativa).   Plant parts (roots and shoots) and soil samples were harvested after a 4-week growth period and analyzed for Zn.  The results show that the growth of plants was depressed by the increase in the soil Zn as affected by waste treatment, with water spinach being the most progressive and producing the greatest biomass.  All plants significantly decreased the concentration of Zn in soils, with water spinach decreased the most significantly.  The absorption of Zn increased with the soil Zn (high linear R2).  Zinc was accumulated greater in plant roots than that in shoots.  All plants were good Zn phytostabilizators.",['Q1'],
21,['FP23'],"The Behavior of Phosphorus Adsorption on Soil in the
Geological Formation of Ranau Tuff Using the Langmuir
Isothermic Model to Support Food Security","In tropical soils, phosphorus (P) adsorption is one of the main processes that control the availability of P for
plant growth. Soils that develop from volcanic material have a high P uptake as the mineral composition contains a lot of
active colloids of Fe and Al which play a crucial role to adsorb P in soil complex. Soils which have a high capacity of P
adsorption, potentially decrease the efficiency of P fertilizers into the soil as it is unavailable for plant growth. Langmuir
Isothermic Model is a mathematical model that can be used to determine the capacity adsorption (Xmax) and the relative
energy (K L) of phosphorus in the soil. This study was therefore aimed to obtain the information on the maximum
phosphorus absorption capacity in the soil samples of Tufa Ranau Geological Formation (TRGF). The basic information
from this research provided the valuable information of P nutrients management in the soil to support the efficiency of P
fertilizer and food security. Soil samples were collected from TRGF area at three zones in West Lampung Regency (1. ±
40 km; 2. ± 30 km; and 3. ± 20 km in the southern area of Lake Ranau). Soil samples were collected from two deph of
soils (0 – 20 cm and 20 – 40 cm). This research was an experimental study that has been conducted in the Laboratory of
Soil Science, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Lampung to analysis the behavior of P adsorption with Langmuir
Isothermic Model. Then the Student-t test was performed to see the difference between the maximum absorption of
phosphorus and the relative energy of phosphorus adsorption in each treatment. The results showed that soil in Balik Bukit
has a maximum adsorption P value (Xmax) which is higher than that of the soil in Sekincau and Batu Brak on TRGF. The
high value of X max is because Balik Bukit may have to do with a high Fe content of 35.95 mg kg-1, since Fe is one of the
causes of high P sorption in the soil. The relative energy of phosphorus adsorption value (K L) in subsurface horizons is
relatively higher than that of in surface horizon so that P in subsurface horizons is relatively difficult to be available when
compared to surface horizons, because the higher K L value makes P more difficult to be available to plants.",['S1'],
22,['FP5'],Influence of Puspa Wood and Coconut Trunk Combination on the Characteristics of Cross-Laminated Timber Bonded with Polyurethane Adhesive,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the characteristic of cross-laminated timber (CLT) made from puspa (Schima wallichii) wood, coconut (Cocos nucifera) trunk, and their combination using a polyurethane (PU) adhesive. The manufacturing of CLT begins with the characterization of the adhesive and wood materials used in this study. The CLT panels are made with dimensions of 100 cm × 30 cm × 3.6 cm. The laminate was organized into three layers with the face/core/back, namely puspa wood (PPP), coconut trunk (CCC), and their combination (PCP and CPC), perpendicular to each other using polyurethane adhesive with a glue spread of 160 g.m-2. The physical and mechanical properties of the CLT were assessed according to the JAS 3079 (2019) standard. The results showed that the polyurethane adhesive used in this study could cure optimally at a temperature of 30°C for 200 minutes. Puspa wood and coconut trunk had different physical and chemical properties but had similar wettability to polyurethane adhesives. The physical and mechanical characteristics of coconut CLT were better than puspa CLT. Based on the overall test results, the puspa hybrid CLT is better than the single wood species of the CLT. In contrast to coconut hybrid CLT, the single CLT of CCC was better than its hybrid CLT.

Moreover, in Indonesia, a country with multilingual and multicultural contexts, the study of oral literature has become an important aspect of investigation. One of the oral pieces of literature that exists in Indonesia is Pisaan, an oral tradition that can be found in Lampung, a province located on the southern tip of the island of Sumatra. Although a considerable amount of oral literature research has been conducted in the Indonesian context; however, to our best knowledge, little research has been paid to Pisaan oral literature, which plays an essential role in the Lampung community. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the oral literature by translating and transforming the Pisaan oral literature into lyrics and musical elements to educate future generations. This study adopted a qualitative approach using several instruments, i.e., semistructured interviews and recording tools, for data collection. A total of four women who were cultural activists in the age range of 37–76 years of age took part in the current study. The collected data were analyzed using a content analysis and a melody structure analysis. The results show that Pisaan has simple syllabification, which dominantly consists of consonant–vowel (CV) and consonant–vowel–consonant (CVC). The rhythm of Pisaan is categorized into syllabic time syllables, emphasizing the stress word based on its syllables. From a musical perspective, the Pisaan oral literature has been successfully translated and written into musical notation with the aim of preservation, which, as far as we are aware, has never before been done. However, we realize that the Western music notation in this study only serves as the initial stage of analysis and does not aim to replace the distinctive native-cultural values of Pisaan, offering an alternative instructional path for improving Lampung oral literature teaching methods and a valuable strategy to diversify undergraduate courses through comparable interdisciplinary inquiries. Therefore, limitations and suggestions for future research are also discussed.","['M1', 'ML', 'MT', 'PL']",Education Research International

Revolutions per Minute (RPM) modification is done by using different pulley diameters. Pulleys with a diameter of 3 inches produce 3500 RPM, a diameter of 4 inches produces 2625 RPM, and a diameter of 6 inches produces 1750 RPM. Parameters observed in this study included working capacity, fuel consumption, and seed size uniformity. The best working capacity is owned by the B2R1 treatment combination of 9,900 seedlings/hour with the feed amount of 3 cassava stalks and 3500 RPM, while the lowest capacity is 6,000 seeds/hour produced in the B1R3 treatment with the feed amount of 2 cassava stems and 1750 RPM. Measuring fuel consumption is necessary using methods that are accurate and of long duration. In this study, the measurement of fuel consumption only lasted for 2 minutes using the method of adding fuel volume. This will cause a high error in the calculation.

Then, the used charcoal materials were mixed with three tapioca concentrations of 8%, 10%, and 12%. The characteristics of the charcoal briquettes, such as density, moisture content, shatter resistance index, calorific value, combustion rate, and compressive strength were observed. The charcoal briquettes with a high percentage of bamboo combination showed to increase the calorific value and the compressive strength but decreased the rate of combustion. In contrast, the low concentration of tapioca glue increased the density, compressive strength, and shatter resistance index but decreased the combustion rate. It was revealed that the used material combination and the adhesive content affected various properties of charcoal briquettes. Therefore, it can be suggested that the materials combination of bamboo and cassava stems waste can be utilized for making briquettes with a low percentage of tapioca adhesive.","['S1', 'SD']",International Journal of Design and Nature and Ecodynamics

its quality deteriorates continuously due to land use change accompanied by housing expansion and
open areas. This study aims at analyzing its water quality and pollution level based on the present
land-use zoning. Three zones are determined based on the dominant land use covering the riverbank
sides. Water sampling was carried out at nine settling points (3 samples per zone) to measure the level of
BOD5, COD, TSS, Escherichia coli contends, and also Pollution Index (PI), as well as the Biodegradable
Index (BI). The results showed that the water has been experiencing pollution for grade-C river overall
data. However, based on the zoning, all of the parameters of the upstream sides are below quality
standard (QS), while at the middle stream, the BOD5 has exceeded QS (21.9-26.4 mg/L), whereas
at the downstream, the parameters of BOD5, COD, and Escherichia coli have exceeded from the QS.
The PI and BI values indicated moderately polluted downstream, with the average biodegradable.
For this reason, paying attention to land use change is important to assess the level of river pollution.
The study results also found that organic matter from domestic is the primary pollutant of the river.
Therefore controlling the upstream in accordance with regional spatial planning regulations and
followed by a conservation movement as well as change people’s behavior to be more caring about
environmental management for catchment areas are the urgent actions for restoring and improving
the river water quality.","['GE', 'SD']",

This study aimed to find the best-crossbred chicken resulting from crossing between local/native roosters and laying hens which produce the highest body weight up to eight weeks of age, and its growth prediction using the Gompertz function. Eighteen (18) native roosters (9 Bangkok roosters, 9 Pelung roosters) and 36 laying hens of strains Isa brown, Lohman brown, and Hyline brown (12 each) were used in this study to produce 360 crossbred chickens. Factorial 2x3 (two male local roosters versus three strains of laying hens) using a completely randomized design with 3 replications was applied in this study. The results showed an interaction between native roosters and layer hens on the body weight of crossbred chickens at eight weeks of age. Crossbred chicken from crossing between Pelung rooster and Isa brown layer hen was the best in body weight at eight weeks of age. This crossbred chicken would reach a mature weight of 3026.89 g with an inflection weight of 1113.53 g and an inflection age of 7.40 weeks. In conclusion, crossbred chicken from crossing between Pelung roosters and layer hens of Isa brown strain was the best crossbred with the highest body weight at eight weeks of age.

The conflict that started at the end of February is ongoing, potentially disrupting economic and trade performance in the global sector, including Indonesia. The battle has the opportunity to increase some food commodity prices, thus hampering the total imports carried out. In addition, other leading commodities (non-oil and gas) such as gold, oil, and coal will also experience significant turmoil due to the conflict that has continued to heat up recently. The study provides an overview of the systemic impact on Indonesia's economic conditions by predicting the short-term possibilities. This study investigates the Russia-Ukraine conflict's initial estimate of the net import value of the two countries and other trading partners. This study uses independent variables, namely oil and gas commodities and gold prices over eleven years (2000-2021). Error Correction Model (ECM) is an analytical method used in this study. This research expects to give an overview to academia, business, industry, and the government in anticipating Indonesia's economic and trade performance to the crisis in Russia and Ukraine. Thus, it is hoped that this research can be used as an illustration of the government to make decisions in allocating import values amid the polemic between Russia and Ukraine so that trade values can be optimal.","['HB', 'HJ']",Jurnal Ekonomi dan Studi Pembangunan (JESP)

Thus, a fuzzy logic load forecasting system IoT is developed in this research. Fuzzy variables used in this system are time of day, days of the week, measured loads, and forecasted loads. The research produced a system that predicts electrical load with one hour of accuracy based on the previous week's data. The average prediction error rate of the system is 9.48%. The implemented system is available on a web server and can be accessed via a web browser, either via a computer or cellphone. The system allows users to monitor and predict electrical load usage regardless of time and place.",['TK'],International Journal of Intelligent Systems and Applications in Engineering

TRANSACTIONS BY INDONESIAN MSME SELLERS IN
E-COMMERCE","This study aims to examine the factors that influence the trust and interest in e-commerce transactions among
MSME actors in Indonesia. Therefore, a study was conducted on the effect of these variables. Background of the problem: The transition of MSMEs in Indonesia to using e-commerce for carrying out their business transactions. Every year, there is an increase in the number of MSMEs converting from conventional to digital, as well as the government's
contribution to assist in the transition. Novelty: The variable of interest in transacting through e-commerce is the basis for conventional businesses to switch to digital, but in other studies, no one has added a variable of
trust as an intervening variable, and several other supporting variables for the interest in transacting via e-commerce. This study presents new research that provides a comprehensive view of the technology acceptance model (TAM) and how it relates to trust and interest in e-
commerce transactions. Research Methods: This study uses a snowball sampling technique by employing a survey of the MSMEs in Indonesia with certain criteria. This study also uses structural equation modeling (SEM) based on partial least squares (PLS). Findings/Results: This study proves that all the variables of trust and interest in e-commerce
transactions are supportive and significant, but there are two hypotheses that do not support them (H3 and H6). This shows that empirically MSMEs are not necessarily interested in using e-commerce for their business transactions. Conclusion: This study provides insight into the
trust and interest in e-commerce transactions among MSME business actors. We suggest that the MSMEs should switch to using e-commerce for their transactions, to develop their businesses into digital ones.","['HC', 'HJ']",

The quality of accounting information in government is heavily dependent on the leadership's commitment, the effectiveness of internal control, and the execution of good governance, according to various published works; nevertheless, this must be demonstrated further. Consequently, this study aims to investigate the link and size of the influence of these three elements on the quality of accounting information and their impact on the efficacy of local government fixed asset management. In Indonesia, 34 provincial governments, 416 district governments, and 98 city governments were surveyed for this quantitative research. This study included 529 participants. The research data was gathered using a questionnaire instrument that included in-person interviews—data analysis using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method with Lisrel 8.8 statistical software. The explanation of research findings is both descriptive and causally explanatory. In general, local governments in Indonesia have excellent accounting data and management of fixed assets. In carrying out local government tasks, the local government has also built an effective internal control system and excellent governance. The study's findings demonstrate that the effectiveness of internal control and the function of good governance substantially impact the quality of accounting data. Similarly, leadership commitment, the importance of good governance, and the accuracy of accounting information substantially impact the success of fixed asset management. However, internal control efficacy does not significantly impact managing local governments' fixed assets.","['HC', 'HJ']",

Asam Tbk Tarahan Port Unit as a place for loading and unloading coal is equipped with a
temporary coal storage area or stockpile. The condition and function of the drainage on the
stockpile as well as the performance of the KPL in each stockpile unit greatly affect the
sustainability of coal management. This study aims to evaluate the dimensions of the MPA used
for the coal management process and analyze the causes of the formation of coal liquid waste
that occurs in the stockpile. This research was conducted by literature study and field
observation. Based on the research that has been carried out, the results obtained are (1) TSS
over capacity in KPL 1, (2) Sediment deposits are quite a lot seen in the drainage channel at
each stockpile, (3) KPL 1, 2, 3, and 4 experience overcapacity every time it occurs. Rainfall and
(4) a long time of water release to the sea and less large runoff release. The condition of the
KPL is due to the high sediment entering the KPL and the drainage, the absence of a barrier
between the drainage and the stockpile area, the size of the KPL and drainage not being able to
accommodate the discharge load and the formation of coal waste in the drainage and KPL due
to runoff water carrying fine coal material so that drainage stockpile not working optimally.
Based on the results of the study, it is necessary to procure a water pump, build stockpile
barriers, increase drainage height, and reverse the KPL. Refunction of the drainage system,
control basin, runoff distribution connecting channel, and what is technically very important is
the addition of stockpile barriers to reduce coal waste entering the environment and prevent

The manufacture of CLT began with basic adhesive characterization and thermo-mechanical analysis. Wood material’s physical and chemical properties were also tested with its response to the PU 1.2 wettability. The CLT (100 ´ 30 ´ 3.60) cm3 was manufactured with 160 g/m2 glue spread at a pressure of 0.80 MPa for 200 minutes. The CLT panels were characterized refers to the JAS 3079  standard. The results show that PU 1.2 had a gelatination time of 182.1 minutes at 25°C, was able to form urethane groups, and experienced an increase in storage modulus at 35°C. Mangium and puspa woods have different physical and chemical properties, but they interact similarly with PU 1.2 wettability. Puspa CLT panel has a higher density than mangium but lower dimensional stability. The bending mechanical properties of hybrid puspa-mangium-puspa CLT were able to match puspa CLT and have one sample of shear strength that met the JAS 3079 standard in both grain directions. Therefore, hybrid puspa-mangium-puspa CLT has the potential to be developed to improve its dimensional stability and mechanical properties.

In this study, the Siombak Water Quality Index (SWQI) is a composite of the characteristics of tide-influenced lake waters and estuaries, and it was developed by following 4 steps: 1) selection of key parameters that were adjusted to the characteristics of Lake Siombak waters, 2) determination of weight (wi) in order to ascertain the relative importance (influence) of parameters in determining the water quality via PCA, 3) determination of subindex values, and 4) determination of the aggregate index. In Lake Siombak, 14 physical and chemical parameters were selected and measured throughout the year. Organic matter, dissolved and suspended matter, phosphate, and discharge are the most significant variables in Lake Siombak, both at high and low tides. As a result, Lake Siombak's primary pollutants are organic matter, suspended matter, and nutrients. According to the SWQI analysis, the water quality in Lake Siombak is better at high tide than at low tide. Water conditions are worse during the dry season (February-August) than during the rainy season (Septrmber-January).",['Q1'],

Based on the results of the analysis with Berger's social construction theory, social construction is formed through 3 (three) dialectical processes namely, the first externalization of the existence of Pantauan Bunting as part of the Besemah Tribe marriage which is intended to introduce the bride and groom to relatives and family so that a harmonious relationship is established in period after marriage. Second, the process of objectivation through the implementing regulations for the Pantauan Bunting tradition succeeded in legitimizing the existence of this tradition in society. Third, the process of internalization through primary socialization by using customary institutions to move the community to be aware of their ancestral heritage so that they continue the tradition.

Knowledge about the effect of sanitation and parental livelihood at three ecological zones on stunting severity at South Lampung Regency is unknown. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of ecological zones, sanitation performance, and parental livelihood on stunting severity in toddlers aged 0-59 months at South Lampung Regency, Indonesia. The cross-sectional study was conducted in a sample of 182 households that were spread over the hilly zone, 82 lowland zones, and 49 coastal zones at South Lampung Regency, Indonesia. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire that captured the sanitation performance and parental livelihood. Toddler’s heights were measured using a standard procedure and categorized manually according to national references. The ordinal logistic regression model was used to claim the effect. The higher probability of toddlers to be stunting was found significant on lowland zone, coastal zone, and clean water from drilled wells source, while lower probability significant on gallon drinking water, standard latrines, wastewater sewerage construction materials from cement and pipes, managed solid waste, ventilation not all rooms, bright lighting in rooms, and father's livelihood as a civil servant and entrepreneur. Stunting severity at South Lampung Regency is affected by ecological zones, sanitation performance, and father’s livelihood.

of the Tulang Bawang River","The Tulang Bawang river is one of the largest rivers in Lampung Province, Indonesia, transporting humans and goods.
Changes in upstream land use, climate, and sedimentation are silting the riverbed and disrupting transportation. To this end, investors and government agencies have submitted various proposals to carry out sand mining downstream to assist the local government in revitalizing transportation. However, some government and community assets are likely to be affected in the upstream part that is planned to be dredged. Therefore, this study aimed to conduct a modeling scenario of riverbed dredging in the lower reaches of the
Tulang Bawang River from the estuary to 11.8 km upstream. It also aimed to review the impact on the environment, especially the impact of flooding and sedimentation by 17.8 km upstream, using the HEC-RAS software. The scenarios of upstream and downstream boundary conditions were used to determine the significance of the impact. The results showed that dredging would cause water level elevation to drop upstream and sediment deposition along the river section dredged. However, the decrease in river water level was
insignificant for the upstream assets and beneficial for reducing flood inundation. The result of sedimentation analysis shows that river dredging leads to morphological changes and may have an environmental impact. Therefore, effective environmental management for dredging needs to be applied to minimize the environmental impact.",['TA'],"International Journal on Advanced Science, Engineering and Information Technology"

daily activities of farmers consist of farming but their capacity is not 
yet high. This finding shows that farmers still need agricultural 
extension agents (AEAs) but the number of AEAs is still limited, 
meaning that extension activities do not run optimally. The factors that 
influence the level of farmer capacity are age, level of formal education, 
length of farming experience, land size, number of dependents, and the

However, there were important problems that occurred in the geothermal field, namely the formation of silica scaling in the production pipe causing the brine injection process to be disrupted, the injection process aims to maintain the volume of the geothermal reservoir and maintain the quantity of production steam in the long run. Therefore, controlling silica in the brine injection path in geothermal fields is very much needed. This paper discussed the decrease in silica mass influenced by pH and the addition of Sodium Lignosulfonate (SLS) surfactants that studying the changes in pH (7, 8 and 9), and surfactant concentrations (0.05, 0.15 and 0.30% (w/v)). The results showed that the dissolved silica in the geothermal solution was reduced and could be controlled by the addition of SLS surfactants. The greater the surfactant concentration and pH, the more the mass of silica will be taken. The best conditions are at pH 9 and SLS surfactant concentration 0.30%w/v.","['Q1', 'TA', 'TD', 'TP']",Effect of pH and Surfactant Concentration Sodium Lignosulfonate (SLS) towards Reduction of Silica Mass from Geothermal Brine

cases where generally crimes are resolved through criminal prosecution in court, but this is 
resolved through dialogue between perpetrators, victims, the families of both parties, and other 
parties who are related to work together. seeking a just solution by emphasizing restoration to 
the original state and not retaliation. This activity aims to increase awareness and knowledge of 
Government Apparatuses and the Pekon Payung Community regarding restorative justice in 
the settlement of criminal cases and to find out the inhibiting factors and efforts to overcome 
obstacles in resolving criminal cases through restorative justice. The specific target in this 
research is to realize Pekon Payung Government Apparatuses and Communities who can 
maximally resolve criminal cases through restorative justice by providing mediation between 
perpetrators, victims, and the community to reach a mutual agreement in restoring the rights of 
perpetrators, victims, and the community, so that this is achieved. justice that is equitable and 
according to the wishes of the parties. The method used in achieving these goals is the delivery 
of material through counseling, directed discussions and question and answer. This activity is

Oil heat treatment (OHT) is one of a wood modification method using vegetable oil as a heat conducting medim. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of temperature OHT on color change (ΔL*, Δa*, Δb*, and ΔE), physical properties (density, moisture content, water absorption, and weight changes), and the compressive strength of mindi (Melia adezarach) and sengon (Paraserianthes falcataria). OHT was conducted using 2 hours duration on temperature 180C, 200C, 220C, and 240C. The results showed that the effect of temperature on wood color inflicted an increase in the values of ΔL*, Δa*,Δb*, and ΔE on higher temperature of OHT. The effect of temperature on the physical properties of wood results in an increase on density at certain temperature and wood species as well as decreasing moisture content, water absorption, and weight changes of wood on higher temperature of OHT. The effect of temperature on mechanical properties of wood results in increasing compressive strength at certain temperatures and types of wood, but there is decrease compressive strength in the higher temperature of OHT.","['S1', 'SD']",Jurnal Teknik Pertanian Lampung

279,['FP5'],Oil palm biomass in Indonesia: Thermochemical upgrading and its utilization,"Indonesia is the world's largest palm oil producing country. The oil palm industry (plantation and milling) generates large amounts of solid waste in the form of empty fruit bunches (EFB), palm kernel shells (PKS), mesocarp fiber (MF), oil palm fronds (OPF), and oil palm trunks (OPT). This leftover waste, collectively termed oil palm biomass (OPB), causes severe environmental pollution, thereby threatening the sustainability of the oil palm industry. Upgrading OPB by thermochemical processes (torrefaction and pyrolysis) has attracted significant interest as a means of recycling the residues and mitigating the environmental damage. This study reviews the previous research on the environment-friendly utilization of OPB in Indonesia. First, general information is presented on OPB in Indonesia (availability, properties, and governmental policy). Second, the torrefaction of OPB for the production of upgraded solid fuel is summarized. Third, the pyrolysis of OPB to produce biochar is reviewed for use as a soil amendment and in carbon storage. The market perspective and life cycle assessment (LCA) of the thermally treated OPB are discussed, targeting the generation of electricity (OPB torrefaction) and agricultural soil enhancement (OPB biochar). The recycling of OPB is expected to contribute to the sustainability and economic success of the oil palm industry and also the net-zero 2060 in Indonesia.","['S1', 'T1', 'TA']",Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews

In Tanggamus, pepper trees are commonly intercropped in coffee plantations with coffee-pepper intercropping type (dominant coffee), pepper-coffee type (dominant pepper), and agroforestry type. The intercropping system plays an important role in improving agro-ecosystems, increasing farm productivity and income. This study aimed to study crops diversity, productivity and revenue of coffee-pepper intercropping farming. This study used a survey method. The survey locations were determined purposively in two sub-districts which were centers of coffee cultivation in Tanggamus, namely Ulu Belu and Air Naningan District. In the Ulu Belu District, the villages of Sinar Banten, Sinar Galih, Petai Kayu were selected purposively, and in the Air Naningan District were Datar Lebuay Village and Air Kubang Village. Primary data was collected by visiting plantations and interviewing farmers. Sample farmers were determined randomly with a total of 137 samples. The diversity of intercrops was analyzed by calculating the Benefit Index Value and Importance Value Index. The results showed that coffee plantations were generally intercropped (79-86%) between coffee and black pepper. Based on the Importance Value Index, in Ulu Belu the most important intercrops were black pepper, banana, avocado and cayenne pepper, while in Air Naningan they were black pepper, jengkol, cayenne pepper and durian. The revenue of intercropping coffee farmers could reach IDR 24 million/hectare/year. This revenue was obtained from both the coffee-black pepper intercropping or the coffee-non-black pepper intercropping. The productivity of intercropping coffee ranged from 528-1,097 kg/hectare. The productivity of black pepper intercrop ranged from 0.45-0.54 kg per tree and contributed 11-29% of coffee revenue.

Different soil types have different characteristics and will affect the AMF population in the soil. Therefore, this study was carried out to determine the AMF population in the soil based on the number of spores in the rhizosphere of oil palm planted in 4 different soil types, namely Dystrudepts, Paleudults, Haplohumods, and Haplosaprists. Soil samples were taken from each soil type at 4 sample points. At each sample point, soil samples were taken from 5 adjacent oil palm trees. Rhizosphere soil samples were taken at 4 points inside the oil palm circle at a depth of up to 15 cm and 4 points from the outside and then composited to represent 1 sample point
for inside and outside the circle. Extraction of AMF spores from soil samples was carried out by the wet sieving method. The results showed that the average number of AMF spores per 50 g of rhizosphere soil from inside and outside the oil palm circle were 66,7 and 53,5 spores for Dystrudepts, 115,5

Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) has been successfully cultivated in low salinity and in freshwater. Some constraints that arise in the cultivation process include the deficiency of macrominerals, such as sodium, magnesium, calcium, and potassium. The presence of these macrominerals and their proportion affect their absorption by shrimp. Therefore, this study aims to determine the effect of different ratios of sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) on the growth and survival rate of Pacific white shrimp reared in freshwater media. A completely randomized design (CRD) was used, with 3 treatments and 4 repetitions. The treatments were represented by different ratios of Na and K, namely: A - 17:1; B - 27:1; C - 37:1. The duration of the experiment was 35 days. The results showed that the ratio of sodium and potassium in freshwater media significantly affected (р<0.05) the growth and survival rate of Pacific white shrimp. B treatment gave the best growth and survival rates, namely 69.50±5.26% and 1.69 ±0.03 g, respectively, with a specific growth rate of 11.90±0.04%.

Soil samples collected from a 22-years-old experimental field one- time amended with heavy-metal-containing waste at 0-60 Mg ha−1 were treated with lime at 0-5 Mg ha−1 and planted with land spinach in a glass-house experiment. After 4 weeks the soil and plant Cu and Zn were analyzed. The results show that the 60 Mg waste ha−1 significantly increased the soil concentrations of Cu and Zn and depressed the land spinach growth. Land spinach slightly lowered the soil concentrations of Cu and Zn in unlimed soils at waste levels ≤15 Mg ha−1. Liming significantly lowered the soil concentrations of Cu and Zn and improved the growth and Cu-Zn uptake of land spinach but attenuated the effect of land spinach in decreasing the soil concentrations of Cu and Zn.

However, the study on torrefaction of andong bamboo pellet is still limited. This study aimed to evaluate the changes in the physical and mechanical properties of Andong bamboo (Gigantochloa pseudoarundinaceae) pellets resulting from torrefaction.  The pellets were torrefied at 200°C, 240°C, and 280°C using an electric furnace for 50 min.  The physical properties analyzed were color, moisture content, density, water adsorption, and resistance to water immersion.  A compressive strength test examined the mechanical property.  The results showed that the color of bamboo pellets torrefied at 200°C, 240°C, and 280°C were changed, showing overall color change (∆E*) values of more than 12. The lightness (L*) of the pellet remarkably decreased with the increase of torrefaction temperature. In other words, the pellet became darker with increasing temperature. The yellow/blue chromaticity (b*) was also decreased with increasing the torrefaction temperature. However, the red/green chromaticity (a*) increased at 200℃ but decreased at 240℃ and 280℃. Moisture content and pellet density decreased with increasing torrefaction temperature.  The pellets’ water adsorption decreased as the torrefaction temperatures increased at 200℃, 240℃, and 280℃.  The results also showed that the torrefied pellets were more resistant to water immersion than the control pellet as they could maintain their original form even after 24 h immersion test.  The compressive strength decreased as increasing the temperature.

However, human resources also have limitations in storing and remembering the data needed for making budgetary decisions. The preparation of government financial statements currently uses the accrual basis, so that more and more data will be available. Information technology support can reduce the gap between the capabilities of human resources and the demands of budget decisions. This study aims to examine and analyze the effect of information technology support on the perceived usefulness of decision making and its implications for the quality of accrual-based accounting. The object of this research is the government of Lampung Province. The population used is the entire Lampung Provincial Government, while the sample used in this study is the Lampung Provincial Government SKPD. The data was obtained through the distribution of questionnaires to the respondents, namely the SKPD of the Lampung Provincial Government.

Experts believed that empathy is an emotional intelligence skill that can be trained and taught. Therefore, it is very important to explore ways to experience and teach emotional empathy. Empathy experiences can be stimulated by reading fiction and other narratives, storytelling, watching movies, and also playing computer games. In this work, our objective is to investigate the effect of video gaming on empathy using a microblogging tool designed to collect user experiences related to empathy. The aim of this research is to contribute by providing a tool to teach, experience, and measure empathy. This research applies quantitative and qualitative methods. We conducted two studies: (1) investigating the correlation between empathic experiences and video games, and (2) a laboratory experiment to evaluate microblogs as a tool for interviews and media to express feelings or opinions related to empathy. Quantitative data were obtained from the IRI questionnaire.  We developed and implemented a microblogging tool. Study 1 involved 100 participants, and study 2 involved 43 participants. As a result, we find that during the interventions, mean scores increase more for male than for female participants. The impact of playing the video game toward empathy is to raise players' fantasies. The game's story or narrative has the most important role to affect players' feelings.

An alternative method of breeding is through genetic transformation, and regeneration via somatic embryogenesis is a promising route to achieve this. As somatic embryogenesis in cassava is genotype-specific, in the present study a protocol has been developed for UJ-3 and BW-1 genotypes. Immature sterile leaves from 7-10 days axillary shoots in a pre-condition medium were used as an explant. Leaves were inoculated on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing picloram(0.0, 7.5, 10.0, 12.5, and 15.0 mg/L) and 1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA, 6 mg/L) for induction of somatic embryos (SEs). Genotype BW-1 showed the best results as early callus formation time i.e. 8.04±0.32 days after induction (dai) compared to UJ-3 (8.67±2.13 dai). The callus fresh weight (0.64 g) was also higher in BW-1 than UJ-3 (0.38 g) after 4 weeks in the callus induction medium (CIM), and the callus formation ranges between 85.19±3.70 to 96.30±3.70% for both genotypes.

The provision of planting material must be well prepared and planned to get the appropriate nursery planting media composition. The Empty Palm Oil Bunches (EFB) biochar application improves soil's chemical and physical properties to provide nutrients for plants. This study aims to determine the effect of the application of EFB biochar on the growth of sengon roots. The experimental design was completely randomized (CRD) by applying four treatment levels and 20 repetitions. The treatments were (A) 100% soil (control), (B) 5% EFB biochar, (C) 10% EFB biochar, and (D) 15% EFB biochar. The data were then analyzed by analysis of variance to see the effect of the treatment on the observed root growth parameters, followed by the 5% Least Significant Difference (LSD) further test to determine differences between treatments. The parameters observed were root length, root volume, root wet weight, and root dry weight. The result showed that the application of EFB biochar increased the growth of sengon roots compared to the control. The greater the dose of the addition of EFB biochar given to the growing media, the more it showed a positive response in improving the growth of sengon roots. In this study, the 15% dose showed the best results compared to other treatments.","['S1', 'SD']",Journal of Sylva Indonesiana

This research used Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium which had been treated with 20% Poly Ethylene Glycol (PEG) 6000 as a drought stress simulation agent and KCl in various concentrations. The purpose of this research is to: (1) determine the effective concentration of KCl for the growth of pea plantlets under drought stress conditions, (2) analyze the content of chlorophyll a, b, and total in pea plantlets resistant to drought stress compared to controls. The research design used was a completely randomized design (CRD) with one factor, namely the administration of KCl at 5 concentration levels: 0%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 0.75% and 1%. The resulting data were analyzed by ANOVA and tested further with the Honest Significant Difference (BNJ) test at the 5% level.

environment to the study of policy implementation arrangements. Using actual empirical data, it
describes the challenge of institutionalizing a new set of social capital and its relationship within
the framework of governance quality to address the question of how social capital interacts with
enhanced implementation. This study's analysis will focus on two hypotheses pertaining to the
question of how social capital is built, the role of government in this process, and how to relate
the role of social capital within the framework of governance quality. To answer the question, the
article employs qualitative methods and case studies to discuss crucial aspects of regulating the
institutionalization of processes and mechanisms of social capital development and the interaction
of social capital within the governance framework that the government will adopt. The villagelevel
independent home based workers group was selected due to national policy and program
support, providing a comprehensive empirical foundation for observing it inside the village
government framework. The findings demonstrate that social capital can improve and influence
the success of policy implementation by establishing a mutually exclusive relationship between
the two and altering the nature and ethics of government deformation, which is directed at two
governance orientations: adopting the four stages of capital development, continuing to utilize
existing local institutions, and presenting female leaders and innovation champions as a strategy
for institutionalizing a new value system. In addition, implementing a strategy to increase relations

in agricultural community","The prevalence of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) in urban areas was 2.6% 
compared to 1.4% in rural areas. However, the proportion of disturbed fasting blood glucose 
(GDPT) and impaired glucose tolerance (TGT) in rural residents was higher than in urban areas, 
namely 3.7% and 5.4%, respectively. Thus, that rural residents are more likely to be at risk of 
developing type 2 DM if no intervention is carried out.
Objectives: This study aims to analyze the determinants of type 2 DM in the agricultural 
community.
Methods: This research was a case-control study. Samples were farmers with type 2 DM (cases) 
and farmers without type 2 DM (controls). The research was conducted in Gedong Tataan District, 
Pesawaran Regency with the number of each group as many as 41 people. Data were collected 
by measuring body mass index and blood pressure using the IPAQ-SF questionnaire and the 
Brinkmann Index.
Results: The results showed that the number of pesticide, family history, and physical activity 
were the determining factors for type 2 DM. Farmers who used >2 types of pesticides had a 2.7 times risk of suffering from type 2 DM compared to those who used one type of pesticide (95% 
CI: 1.109-6,615). Farmers with a family history of type 2 DM had a 16.0 times possibility of 
suffering from type 2 DM compared to those without a family history of type 2 DM (95%: 4.77 -
53.85). Farmers with low physical activity had 4.2 chances of suffering from type 2 DM compared 
to those who had high physical activity (95% CI: 2.587-6.671).
Conclusions: Promotive and preventive efforts are needed, especially for farmers who use 
pesticides, family history of type 2 DM and have low physical activity.",['RA0421'],
